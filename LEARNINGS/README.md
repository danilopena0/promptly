## Key Insights (Quick Reference)

<!-- Top 5-10 most important learnings -->

1. **Context persistence is critical** - CLAUDE.md and ARCHITECTURE.md survive context resets; raw session memory doesn't
2. **Capture learnings in real-time** - Retrospective documentation misses nuance; write it when you discover it
3. **Checkpoints enable experimentation** - Frequent commits let you try risky changes safely
4. *(Add more as you discover them)*

## How to Add Learnings

1. **During a session**: Dump raw insights into `ITERATION_LOG.md`
2. **After iteration**: Promote valuable insights to `LEARNINGS/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
3. **When patterns emerge**: Extract to `LEARNINGS/patterns/*.md`
4. **Update this index** to keep it navigable
